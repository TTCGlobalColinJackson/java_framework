# java_framework
**Template Java-Selenium framework**

This template project incorporates several features comprising a basic working Java-Selium test framework.

    JUnit - for unit testing

    Maven - for project management

    Java - base language

    Cucumber - for test scenario specification
 
    Selenium - for GUI-based automation

    Cucumber Reports - for reporting

    Log4J - for logging

A seperate project will add Selenide for Selenide based frameworks (raw selenium and selenide configurations cannot easily co-exist in the same project).
